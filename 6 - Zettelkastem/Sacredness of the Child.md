# [[William Blake]] - An Angry Believer

In his poem series (TODO), Blake establishes that **each & every child is**:
- Precious,
- Sacred,
- Pure.

That children is the sacred foundation of the world, their innocent imagination should be left to wonder.  [["Childhood is measured out by sounds and smells and sights, before the dark hour of reason grows." - John Betjeman]]

However, one morning seeing a child **set in chains & locked outside of the house for inobedience**, (an example of [[Idea that Children Should be Obedient (Industrial Revolution]]), this COMPLETELY **GOES AGAINST** *BLAKE"S BELIEF.*

Making him **FURIOUS**, communicated in his poem series (TODO). 

An example of how [[When the world becomes twisted, ARTISTS are the FIRST voices speaking out.]]
