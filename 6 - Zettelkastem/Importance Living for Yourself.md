### Seen in [[Avatar - Way of the Fire]]
*Core Presentation:*
>Man is easily limited by his **assumptions** and **environmental expectation**, but to live a happy life, he must ***think independently*** and ***act for himself.***

Seen in the Colonel, who lived off the memories of his dead previous and began to pivot towards and even take take a liking to the avatar way. 

However, limited by his memories, expectations, assumptions, but particularly an ***inability to think for himself*** he eventually was **held back from happiness** with his son.
