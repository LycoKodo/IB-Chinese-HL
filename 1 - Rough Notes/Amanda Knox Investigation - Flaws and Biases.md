Instead of adopting a socratic-like approach to logically approach the investigation, Amanda Knox's investigation was filled with emotions and manipulation, where the goal is **NOT to find the objective truth**, but rather ***EMOTIONAL SATISFACTION***.

For instance:
- Italian police's questioning of Amanda, repeting questions because "they didn't hear the answer they wanted".
- HIV-trick to get Amanda to list her lovers, potentially intent being to frame her as a slut
- Inconsideration for the emotional burden onto Amanda and her BF.

> +Additionally
> 	The lack of focus on Rudy, a black man, shows how because less people are defending or emphathetic ykwis for a black man committing a rape related crime, shows again how the **democratic justice system's** biggest weakness, is the **emotional bias** of its members. 
> 
> - More people are likely to defend Amanda than Rudy
> - Although Rudy's action of fleeing the country is a horrible decision, but this does not interfere with the crime directly. 


>> "Pleasure at any cost. This is at the heart of most crimes."
>> "(people would come up and shake my hand and congraduate) It gives me satisfaction"
>>  - *the detective guy*

> Imo the detective guy is not logical enough, hes way too **emotional-centric**.
> 
> This can be seen in how he finds joy in such investigations, being the fame and recognition and people's approval.
> 
> ⭐️ Could mean that he may have a bias against **American/Liberalist** individuals (+ N's discrimination against southern italians). (His generation is also post war US economy boom, where outgoing American tourists flooded EU and were hated.)
> 
> >""Because Perugia is my little homeland"" - underscores this bias of geography.

#### WHY WASN"T THERE INDEPENDENT FORENSICS IN THE **FIRST PLACE?**
- The contamination issue etc was foremost, demonstrates unprofessionalsim in investigation
- Further, police was way too influenced by their own bias, intepreting things the way they want!

>"You can't interpret it for what you want it to be"
>*Dr Carla Vecchiotti (Ind. Reviewer)*

			For example of biased intepretation: THe Knife DNA Sceme
