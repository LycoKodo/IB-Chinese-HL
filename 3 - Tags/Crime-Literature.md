**Crime Fiction** - A genre focus on exploring a case, and is generally **nonlinear**, with the answer slowly revealed through numerous red herrings.

**True Crime** - usually a lot more unpredictable, as seen in the [[Amanda Knox Investigation - Flaws and Biases]], due to how *perception != sensation*.
