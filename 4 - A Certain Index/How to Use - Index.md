Once a tag gets so big, we need to organise this. 

This is done by adding **Subheadings** into the Index, and moving them into this folder. 

Within the subheadings, we link all relevant notes to the subheading, while linking the subheading itself to the index. 

This effectively creates large "chapters" in our mindmap.
